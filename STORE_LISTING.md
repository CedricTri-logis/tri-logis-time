## Full Description (4000 chars max)

GPS Clock-In Tracker is a workforce management app built for cleaning and facilities teams. Employees clock in and out with GPS-verified locations, track cleaning sessions via QR codes, and managers get full visibility into team activity.

**Shift Management**
Clock in and out with a single tap. Your GPS location is automatically recorded for attendance verification. A live timer shows your active shift duration, and your full shift history is always available.

**GPS Location Tracking**
During active shifts, the app records your location at regular intervals to create a verifiable route of your workday. Location tracking runs in the background so you can use your phone normally while working. Tracking stops automatically when you clock out.

**QR Code Cleaning Sessions**
Scan QR codes posted at rooms and studios to check in and out of cleaning sessions. Track exactly how long each cleaning task takes. If a QR code is damaged, manual entry is available as a fallback.

**Offline-First Design**
Works without an internet connection. Clock in, clock out, and scan QR codes even in basements or areas with poor reception. All data syncs automatically when connectivity is restored, so you never lose a record.

**Shift History & Reports**
View your complete shift history with dates, durations, and locations. Managers can view team-wide reports with statistics and export data as PDF or CSV files for payroll and compliance.

**Team Management**
Managers and admins see real-time team status, active shifts, and employee statistics on a dedicated dashboard. Search, filter, and review individual employee history and shift routes on a map.

**Security & Privacy**
All local data is encrypted on-device. Authentication is secured with industry-standard protocols. Location data is only collected during active shifts and is never shared with third parties.

**Key Features:**
- One-tap clock in/out with GPS verification
- Background location tracking during shifts only
- QR code scanning for cleaning session tracking
- Full offline support with automatic sync
- Shift history with route visualization on maps
- PDF and CSV export for payroll/compliance
- Team dashboard for managers and admins
- Encrypted local storage (AES-256)
- Battery optimization awareness
- Role-based access (employee, manager, admin)

GPS Clock-In Tracker is designed for cleaning companies, facilities management firms, and any organization that needs verified shift tracking with location proof.

Note: This app uses background location tracking during active work shifts to provide continuous attendance verification. A persistent notification is displayed while tracking is active.

## Background Location Video Guide

Google requires a video demonstrating background location usage. Record a screen capture showing:

1. Open the app and show you are NOT clocked in (no location tracking)
2. Tap "Clock In" - show the notification appears indicating tracking is active
3. Minimize the app / go to home screen
4. Show the persistent notification is visible (proving background tracking)
5. Return to the app and tap "Clock Out"
6. Show the notification disappears (tracking stopped)
7. Show that no location tracking occurs when not in a shift

Keep the video under 30 seconds. Upload it as an unlisted YouTube link in the Play Console.
