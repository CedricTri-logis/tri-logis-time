# Specification Quality Checklist: Offline Resilience

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec builds upon existing offline capabilities from Spec 003 (Shift Management) and Spec 004 (Background GPS Tracking)
- This spec focuses on hardening and extending offline resilience rather than introducing new core functionality
- Key new capabilities: extended storage (7 days), sync status visibility, conflict resolution, exponential backoff
- The 7-day offline duration assumption may need validation with actual users in remote work environments
